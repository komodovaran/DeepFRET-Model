# DeepFRET-Model
Repository for the model training.

To reproduce publication model:
1. Make sure your environment reflects requirement.txt
2. Run `generate_data.py` and input the number of traces (we used 250k initially, which ends up being ~150k after balancing)
3. Run `train_model.py`. Be sure to set `exclude_alex_fret=False` for the full model.
